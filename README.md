# Activity 5 - Concurrent Echo Server with Python

Working on this Activity gave me basic knowledge on creating a simple chat between server and client.

## To test the program
Make sure you're in the root of the folder.
open 2 or 3 powershells depending if you wish to connect 2 clients.

The first powershell will be responsible for server.py
In the command line type the following:
```
py server.py
```
The second and third (if you are testing multiple clients) powershell will be responsible for client.py
In the command line type the following:
```
py client.py
```
Now in the client powershells, type in a message and the server will echo the same message back to you.
If the server is not on, an error will appear.

If you want to disconnect from the server, in the client powershell type in:
```
quit
```
